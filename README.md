# RandomWorkoutApp

This code generates a GUI by the use of the tkinter library of python. This GUI then allows for the user to choose from what body part they would like to excercise, how many
sets of each workout they would like and how many excercises they would like to do per bodygroup. The excercies are pulled from the exercies.csv file which contains excercies
for each body group that I have written. More can easily be added by editing the csv file. 

The main limitation of this program is that the excercies and the number of reps that it shows is included in the csv. In the future I would like for a way for the program to 
find a workout from a larger database. Addtionally, many of the reps of the excercises are written as 8-12 or 7-15 reps. In the future I would like for the user to be able to input
the amount of reps they were able to do and implement way target rep for the next workout the person does. For example, if a person was only able to do 10 pushes, they would input
that into the app and the app would give a target of doing 13 pushups the next week they workout. This way the body part gets stronger over time and allows for the user to 
effectively track that.
